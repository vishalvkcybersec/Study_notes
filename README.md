# Study_notes
This repository contains my curated notes on cybersecurity, ethical hacking, and Linux system administration. It serves as a reference for tools, techniques, and best practices that Iâ€™ve gathered during my learning journey. These notes are regularly updated as I continue to expand my knowledge in these fields.
